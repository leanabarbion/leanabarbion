#### About Me

📚 Education: I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science, diving deep into the fascinating world of algorithms, data structures, and innovative tech solutions.

🌴 Background: Originally from the beautiful island of Tahiti, I bring a unique perspective to the tech world. Living on an island teaches you how to be resourceful and innovative - something I bring to my studies and projects in computer science.

😄 Fun Fact: Here's a geeky joke for you - Why do programmers prefer iOS development when they're on an island? Because it's easier to deal with Swift currents!

👥 Teamwork: I excel as a team member, always eager to collaborate and bring out the best in my peers.

🌍 Environmental Sustainability: Passionate about solving problems related to environmental sustainability, I always look for ways to integrate green solutions into my tech projects.
